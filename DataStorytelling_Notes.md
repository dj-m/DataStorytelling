# Data Storytelling #

Data scientists tell stories when building data products and when communicating with employers or clients about those products. 

Variables associated with datastories:
- Who is your audience
- What questions you're trying to answer
- Why your audience should care
- What your major insights are 
- What impact you want to have by sharing your findings

### Exploratory Data Analysis & Effective Visualizations ###

Data exploration is difficult becasue we're not always sure what we're looking for...

| You ought to always be guided by initial hypotheses. Having a good question is important because of its purpose as a guide. |

To overcome this it's best to use visualizations and questions that will guide your exploration. Ultimately, you're looking at what it is that this data can tell you.

That said, once you start exploring the data, your question may change. More questions may arise and you may find things in the data you didn't expect.

| ![Data](images/CS109_Lecture3_EDA/Slide_07.jpg) |
| Data Explanation:<br>Gram Staining: positive = purple<br>Gram Staining: negative = pink<br>Min. Inhibitory Concentration = amount of antibiotic needed to combat that particular bacteria, in ml per gram |
| ![Data questions](images/CS109_Lecture3_EDA/Slide_08.jpg) |
| Initially one can ask about most/least effective antibiotic against the different bacteria.<br>Also, how does gram stain status impact/correlate to the effectiveness of the antibiotic? |
| ![Data visualizations 1](images/CS109_Lecture3_EDA/Slide_09.jpg) |
| This visualization tells us about the effectiveness of the antibiotic and whether the gram stain is positive/negative. |
| ![Data visualizations 2](images/CS109_Lecture3_EDA/Slide_10.jpg) |
| Here, a different question can be asked/answered regarding antibiotice resistance.<br>Once you ask the right questions you'll get surprising results. In this case it took science about 30 years to figure this out. |

| In science, it's not always about the eureka, but more the 'that's funny' moment. You look at your data and think, 'wow, that's weird.'<br>That's Funny [article](https://www.americanscientist.org/article/thats-funny) by Howard Wainer & Shaun Lysen |

The term **Exploratory Data Analysis** came about as a result of the work of statistician John Tukey.<br><br>
