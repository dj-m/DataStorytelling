# Data Storytelling #

Data scientists tell stories when building data products and when communicating with employers or clients about those products. 

Variables associated with datastories:
- Who is your audience
- What questions you're trying to answer
- Why your audience should care
- What your major insights are 
- What impact you want to have by sharing your findings
